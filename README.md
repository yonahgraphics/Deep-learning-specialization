# Deeplearning-specialization
My assignments for the [***Deep Learning Specialization***](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) taught by Andrew Ng. The specialization consists of five courses:
 * [***Neural Networks and Deep Learning***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome) Â 
 * [***Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/home/welcome) 
 * [***Structuring Machine Learning Projects***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects/home/welcome)
 * [***Convolutional Neural Networks***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks)
 * [***Sequence Models***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models)
 
 I upload all my assignments because I want to document my progress. I strongly recommend you to not use these as anything other than a reference. Wish you the best journey in DL!
